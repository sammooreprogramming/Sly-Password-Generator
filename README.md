# Sly Password Generator Challenge

## Description
In this challenge, we were assigned to write the backend functionality, or logic that powers the software, for a pre-designed shell of a random password generator.
I had a good time figuring this one out because it was the first challenge that was all about Javascript, which I enjoy a lot, apparently.

I learned of the importance of backend code, and that I enjoy the process of learning it.
